iVend INSTALL

iVend version 1.0 of 5 January 2001
coding by Bill Welliver <hww3@riverweb.com>

For complete installation instructions, please see the file InstallationAdministration.* located in the docs/ directory of your iVend distribution.

What is iVend?
--------------

iVend is a module for the Roxen Challenger web server which allows electronic
commerce functions to be provided quickly and easily. iVend supports 
multiple stores from a single installation, and provides direct support 
for SQL databases to handle product and order tracking.

iVend is currently in the early stages of development, and as such 
there will be bugs and missing features. Hopefully with the support of 
alpha and beta testers iVend will grow up to be a mature, powerful and 
useful tool.

What do I need for iVend to work?
---------------------------------

* A system running Caudium 1.0 or Roxen Challenger version 1.3 or higher **with Crypto
  enabled**. See the section "A Note About Compatibility" below.
  iVend will not run without Crypto (you shouldn't even think about doing
  electronic commerce without crypto anyhow.)
* A copy of Pike in your PATH for running the setup scripts.
* An SQL database server supported by Pike and Roxen Challenger.
  (iVend was developed using mysql3.22, however other dbms systems should 
  work as well with minimal changes to the code.) 
* Admistrative rights to the database system, as well as Roxen.
* A working knowledge of HTML, SQL databases, and Unix.
