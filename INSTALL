INSTALL

very preliminary installation instructions:

1. Unpack the iVend distribution using this command:

    tar xzvf ivend-1.0.XX.tar.gz (XX is the build number)

This should give you a directory called ivend/. Do not move or rename
files in this directory.

2. Make sure that the iVend distribution directory is in Roxen's module
search path. 

3. Be sure to set all the directories in the iVend section of the Roxen
Config Interface. If you don't provide the correct directory information,
iVend will not work properly.

For each store you set up you'll need to do the following:

1. Create a directory and fill it with the proper html files. You can
duplicate the examples/ directory as a starting point (ie cp -r examples
someplaceelse).

2. Create a database with the sql server of your choice and generate the
nessecary tables. Again, you can use the sample database schema located in
the examples/ directory.

3. Create an RSA keypair using the scripts/make_keys.pike script.

4. Using the administration interface, provide the required information
to activate the new store.

5. Add groups and products using the store's administration interface.
