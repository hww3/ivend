A note about compatibility
--------------------------

iVend has been tested with Roxen 1.(2/3).25 and up. If you are using iVend
with Roxen 1.(2/3).25 through 29, you will need to replace the file
RSA.pmod in server/lib/pike/modules/Standards.pmod/PKCS.pmod with a copy
of RSA.pmod available from the same location you downloaded iVend.  
Releases after .29 do not require any patches to the Roxen base release. 

iVend was written to work with the mySQL database system. There is very
little reason that another RDBMS would not work. Your mileage may vary.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1. Unpack the iVend distribution using this command:

    tar xzvf ivend-1.0.XX.tar.gz (XX is the build number)

This should give you a directory called ivend/. We'll call this
directory the iVend distribution directory. Do not move or rename
files in this directory.

2. Make sure that the iVend distribution directory is in Roxen's module
search path. 

3. Be sure to set all the directories in the iVend section of the Roxen
Config Interface. If you don't provide the correct directory information,
iVend will not work properly:

  a. iVend Root Directory: This is the iVend distribution directory.
  b. iVend Config Directory: This is usually ivend/configurations.
  c. iVend Data Directory: This is usually ivend/data.

4. Assign values for any other configuration variables such as config user
and password.

Setting Up a New Store
----------------------

For each store you set up you'll need to do the following:

There is a script called create_store.sh in the scripts directory which
may be helpful for creating new stores. It makes certain assumptions about
your setup (such as the use of mySQL), but if you don't deviate too much
from the standard, you should have good results. The create_store.sh
script assumes that you have already created a database and have a
username and password that has create/update permissions for that database
before you start. 

1. Create a directory and fill it with the proper html files. You can
duplicate the examples/ directory as a starting point (ie cp -r examples
someplace else).

2. Create a database with the sql server of your choice and generate the
nessecary tables. Again, you can use the sample database schema located in
the examples/ directory.

3. Create an RSA keypair using the scripts/make_keys.pike script.

4. Using the administration interface, provide the required information
to activate the new store.

5. Add groups and products using the store's administration interface.
