iVend 1.2 License

iVend's license has not been finalized. Please stay tuned for more
information.

At this point I'm leaning toward a mySQL style license. That is, ivend is
largely free, but if you plan to make any money using it, you are strongly
urged to buy a license for it. Also, paying for iVend places your requests
higher on the TODO list. Besides, you could be paying $5-10,000 for a
solution like iCat...

as always, comments and suggestions are welcome.
