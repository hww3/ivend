About the Order Total Shipping Module
-------------------------------------

This module will calculate shipping charges based upon the total amount of
product purchased, before discounts and taxes are applied. This module
will initialize all required database tables itself, and provides a
browser based administration interface.

Using the OTShipping Module
---------------------------

After choosing this module to handle shipping for a store, you should
enter that store's administration interface, and choose "Shipping
Administration". If this is the first time you are using this module, or
any shipping module, you will note a message indicating that the module
needs to be initialized. By selecting the link that is provided, the
module will create any shipping tables nessecary for proper operation. If
you have used a different shipping module previously, your shipping types
will be retained.
