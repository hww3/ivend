coding by Bill Welliver <hww3@riverweb.com>

What is iVend?

iVend is a module for the Roxen Challenger web server which allows electronic
commerce functions to be provided quickly and easily. iVend supports 
multiple stores from a single installation, and provides direct support 
for SQL databases to handle product and order tracking.

iVend is currently in the very early stages of development, and as such 
there will be bugs and missing features. Hopefully with the support of 
alpha and beta testers iVend will grow up to be a mature, powerful and 
useful tool.

What do I need for iVend to work?

* A system running Roxen Challenger version 1.2 or higher.
* An SQL database server supported by Roxen Challenger.
  (iVend was developed using mysql, however other dbms systems should 
  work as well.) 
* A working knowledge of HTML, SQL databases, and Unix.

Installing iVend

1. Untar the ivend distribution file. You should get a directory called 
ivend. This directory contains the module, data files and example store.

2. Add the ivend directory to your module search path using the Roxen 
Administration interface.

3. Choose 'Add Module' to a virtual server.

4. Set the configuration username and password, as well as the module's root
configuration directory. This is normally ivend/data.

5. Save the settings and you're ready to go! iVend will be mounted by 
default on /ivend/, and configuration is located at /ivend/config/.

Adding a new store

1. Create a directory where all store related files will be kept.

2. Create a database where iVend will store all store related 
transactions. mysql users can use the 'mysqladmin create dbname' command. 
Other systems may vary. Provide select/insert/delete access to a user so 
that iVend can connect and use this db.

3. Create data tables in that database for iVend to use. A sample schema 
file is located in the examples directory. These tables can contain as 
many and varied fields as you like, but at least the following must be 
present:

products		groups			product_groups

id string key		id string key		group string
name string		name string		product string
image string		image string
price decimal(2)	price decimal(2)

orders

id string
product string


The above fields are considered 'special' by iVend, and are expected to 
be present. The presence of additional fields is purely optional, however 
fields such as shipping wights and costs, product descriptions or 
inventory counts may also be useful.

4. Modify the iVend templates using standard HTML, RXML and additional 
IVML (ivend markup language) tags. A listing of IVML tags can be found in 
the section labelled IVML. The minimum files required by ivend to operate 
must be present in each store's data directory and are described below:

index.ivml -- the default page displayed upon arrival at the store.
groups.ivml -- this page is used to display all available store groups.
group_template.ivml -- template used to generate group listings.
product_template.ivml -- template used to generate individual product listings.
cart.ivml -- handles shopping cart functions.

examples of these files are located in the examples directory.

5. Enter the iVend configuration interface by pointing your browser to
http://virtualserver/ivend/config. You will pe prompted for the ivend config
username and password.

6. Click on 'New Store Configuration'. A form will be presented in which 
you should provide the information requested. Note: some information may 
not be nessecary ( such as database users and passwords, etc).

7. After completing the information, click on the 'Add' button. You should be
returned to the main configuration screen. Click on the 'Save Changes' 
link to save the configuration.

8. You should now be able to point your browser to
http://virtualserver/ivend/storeid where storeid is the id name of the 
store you just created. You should be able to move around the various 
options, although there won't be any groups or products to choose from.

9. Point your browser to http://virtualserver/ivend/storeid/admin. This 
will bring up the iVend Store Administration Page, from which you can add 
and delete products and groups. This is also the central point for 
monitoring orders and store status.

10. Create some new groups, giving each a unique group id. It should be 
noted that currently, groups and products cannot share the same id. You 
can use your browser to add a graphic associated with that particular 
group. Also, that graphic must be in gif format currently.

11. After adding groups, you can add products, placing them in as many 
groups as desired. After addition, products and groups will become 
instantly available in the store.

IVML

The following tags are additions or modifications of existing HTML and 
RXML tags. They are only available within the iVend system.

<a></a> has been modified to provide session tracking capabilities. 
Additionally, the following attributes have been added:

cart: generates a link to the store's shopping cart page.
groups: generates a link to the store's group listing page.
checkout: generates a link to the store's checkout page.

<ivstatus> when used on product pages, this tag will display information about
additions to a user's shopping cart, and possibly other information from 
the iVend system.

<ivmg> is used to insert an image from a product or group stored in ivend's
database.

<cart> displays the store shopping cart.
