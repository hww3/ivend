THIS DOCUMENT DESCRIBES IVEND SPECIFIC MARKUP TAGS AND CONTAINERS.

<IVML>..</
<HTML>..</

The IVML and HTML containers are interchangable. They are the master containers that enable parsing of all other iVend tags. Each page within a store should contain the HTML/IVML container. All attributes are passed through the HTML/IVML container.

ATTRIBUTES

QUIET do not output HTML container. Only return the parsed contents of the container. (Optional)
EXTRAFIELDS 

<ICART>..</

Display the Cart. Items in the cart to be updated and deleted.

You may specify as many fields from the products table to be included in the cart display in addition to the item's price, options selected and quantity. The first field specified by the FIELDS attribute will be displayed with a link to the product's information page.

Upon a successful access to the cart, the contents of this container are returned following the Cart Widget along with a TRUE result. If an error occurrs, a FALSE result will be returned, allowing the use of <ELSE>...</.

ATTRIBUTES

FIELDS	A comma seperated list of fieldnames to include in the cart display.	(Optional)
NAMES	A comma seperated list of names to use as column headers in the cart display. If not specified, the cart will use the values from the FIELDS attribute.	(Optional)
CONT	If specified, the cart will display a button labeled "Continue" with the value of this attribute as the destination.	(Optional)
CHECKOUT_URL	If specified, the cart will display a button labelled "Check Out" with the value of this attribute as the destination.	(Optional)


<ADDITEM>

Generates and responds to requests to add items to the session cart. 

This tag has two modes: generate and respond. To add an item, you must generate a request, then respond to that request. These two actions may occur on the same page, or a request generated on one page may be responded to on another. Multiple items may be added at one time. See the examples below for more details.

You do not have to use this tag to generate a request; a properly formatted form submission to a page with a listening <additem> tag will also work for this purpose. If you place multiple <additem> tags on one page, the first <additem> tag only will add the items.

If no arguments are supplied to this tag, <additem> will respond to requests only. A tag set to generate the request may also respond, allowing items to be added to the cart without requiring a visit to a different page.

When the ITEM attribute is present, the tag will generate a full or partial add item request. By default, a form is generated with an optional quantity input box, as well as a form submit button.

ATTRIBUTES

ITEM Product code of the item to be added. (Required for request generation)
NOFORM Do not produce the html form container. Use when manually generating part of the request, or when using multiple <additem> tags to add more than one item at a time to the session cart. (Optional)
SILENT Surpress display of a form submit button and quantity input box. (Optional)
SHOWQUANTITY Display a quantity input box as part of the request generation form. This attribute has no effect if the SILENT attribute is used. (Optional)
QUANTITY Default quantity to add or display (if SHOWQUANTITY attribute is present) for a particular item. If this attribute is not present, the default value is 1. (Optional)
ACTION The action page containing an <additem> tag for reception of the additem request. Has no effect when used with NOFORM. If not provided, the default value is the current page. (Optional)

EXAMPLES

To display a form for adding item ABC123 with a quantity box, use the following code:

<additem item="ABC123" showquantity>

To add item ABC123 and DEF456 to the cart, use the following:

<form action="my_additem_page.html">
<additem item="ABC123" quantity="1" noform silent>
<additem item="DEF456" quantity="1" noform>
</form>
